title: "Hauz Khaz village and Dharavi experience: Study India Programme"

---

Original article can be found on the [British Council website] (http://blog.britishcouncil.org.in/hauz-khaz-village-and-dharavi-experience-study-india-programme/), it talks about my experience during the Study India Programme 2013 that I was lucky enough to be selected for. 

It included an internship at Maxposure Ltd, a publishing company and many other industry visits and activities.
