Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Now to begin the long endeavour of updating it with all my posts from my old [blog] (https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=6430892894928593083#publishedposts).
