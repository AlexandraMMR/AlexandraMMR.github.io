title: "10 things I love about Romania"

---

This post might be a little quirky but I am writing this blog more like a personal diary to see how I develop as a person and it is as well a personal project. Regardless of people viewing or reading it I will keep going and hope it will develop into an interesting page that others would like to browse.

Without further ado, here are 10 of the many reasons why I love Romania:

1. This is my birthplace, that special somewhere where you feel at "home". Although, I will get accustomed and grow to love my new home I know that Romania will always have a special place in my mind and that my heart will skip a beat every time I will return here. It is such a beautiful place with amazing landscapes and traditions, cultural attractions and booming nightlife and so much more. (I will probably make a future post with my favourite places to party, visit, eat and relax in my home country if I'll feel homesick).

2. This is the place where I received a comprehensive education and I am not saying that it was all hearts and flowers but I am glad that I have accumulated a great amount of knowledge that piqued my interest to want to discover the world and never stop learning and improving my life. It also made me realize how much times have changed and that if I can make my dreams come true here I can make it anywhere.

3. This is a country where you can never get bored of sight seeing and where you can go from skiing to swimming to cave exploring to hiking to bungee jumping all in one day. It has mountains, plains, hills, beaches and the breath taking Danube Delta with its wild horses and unique ecosystem. All I can say is that a lifetime to visit all of its treasures wouldn't be enough.

4. This is where people make you feel welcomed even if you just came out of nowhere and knocked on their door asking for a glass of water. It's most likely they will welcome you in and ask if they can assist you with anything else. Moreover, if you are invited to a party or wedding or gathering, be sure that you will have a great time and the hosts will get over the top to make the most of your time there.

5. This is the place where, as a foreigner, you will be force fed and you will not complain because the food is good and made from the heart, as well as get drunk from "tuica" ( a stronger cousin of vodka) or other fiery liquors.

6. This is where winters are extremely cold and you have wonderful puffy white snow for Christmas, also meaning that you can go snowboarding or skiing or just drinking mulled wine with your mates in a nice pub enjoying the homey atmosphere, but you also have very hot summers where you can lay and bask in the sun, enjoying your summer break and going to cool down in the sea or river.

7. This is where dozens of battles and wars were fought, where people sacrificed their lives so that we could have this broken but wonderful country, where revolutions took place and where the romans came and spread their glory. So many vestiges of the times that have preceded our lifetime are left here but unfortunately not many of them are being taken care of as they should.

8. This is the land of all possibilities, you can get whatever you want if you know where to look and who to talk with, you can get whatever else they can get anywhere in the EU or world if you try. Also, here is where you learn how hard life is, how people will try to slow you down and break you, but you must also learn that you can overcome everything and still reach your goals. It teaches you how to think and how to act.

9.  This is where food tastes best, both raw and cooked, and where mum's cooking has thought me how to cook. Here, in Romania, there is an "obsession" with food, it must look and taste good, Romanians like to try everything and they like to cook at home besides going out for lunch. 

10. This is where half of my life is, it's where I've grown into who I am. I spent almost 20 years here, I could say the most important 20 as this is where I became ME and where I discovered what I wish to become in the future, I am not talking about a profession but a path in life and living.

Romania is the most beautiful place on Earth for me because it is me.
