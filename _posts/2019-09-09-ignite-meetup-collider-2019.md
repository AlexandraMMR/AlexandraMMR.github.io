title: "Meetup Collider - Bournemouth edition"

---

It was a rainy summer night in Bournemouth, 09/09/2019, our more than 15 volunteers were all getting ready to receive our over 100 guests (internal and external) coming to "collide" in the first ever Meetup Collider event to be hosted at the Bournemouth Technology Center. The event is the product of our Ignite groups and was supported by 3 local digital and tech communities (DOXMOUTH - DevOps Exchange Bournemouth, OWASP Dorset and UX Coffee Bournemouth).
Not only was this the first time an event like this had been run at the BTC but also a first for the South Coast! 

**So...what is a Meetup Collider?**

A Meetup Collider is where we invite external digital/ tech meetups to host their events on-site, and then we 'collide' them in order to grow awareness of each other, of J.P. Morgan and to strengthen our ties with the local tech community. Overall, the idea is that each meetup gets together and conduct their meetup independently, then we bring everyone together.

In the run up to the event, we were busy preparing attendee badges, feedback jars, signage, donut displays and ordering a monumental amount of local pizza from Bournemouth Pizza Co, that was amazing and so tasty!
As our guests started to arrive, we welcomed them with doughnuts and drinks, followed by a short welcoming speech from the wonderful and supportive Simon Cox. Guests were then escorted to various "Meetup" areas (one per community), each comprising a JPM host and also a JPM talk (with our very own amazing professionals, PETER JUPP, ANDREW GILBERT, MICHAEL WARNER, PAUL TRENCHARD SEYS) who welcomed the attendees and looked after them.

The talks were focused on UX, in a corporation such as JPMC and also how to evangelize UX, Security, with app security, an OWASP intro and how to become a pen tester, but also DevOps, with a similar approach to UX, with a talk on DevOps journey at JPMC and also multi-layered security in cloud and IT budgets in enterprises.

When the meetups concluded, everyone gathered in the Atrium area for networking, pizza and drinks. There was an amazing vibe and atmosphere, bringing all these amazing professionals under one roof, everyone was really thankful and enthused and most asked when the next one is happening!

Thank you all for arranging the Collider last night, it was a wonderful event and I already have the welcome board up in my office. We had a huge amount of positive feedback - and some requests for access to the photos from the event. - Mark Davison (OWASP Dorset Chapter Lead)

I love the energy, enthusiasm and willingness to push the boundaries, coupled with professional and diligent communications. 

We just wanted to say a huge thanks for hosting the event last night, all very much appreciated. It would be great to partner with you on any future events, so please lets all keep in touch. - Tony Chapman (DevOps Exchange Organizer)

It was a truly ground breaking and epic event and I was so proud to see so many from the local external tech community coming together in our ‘home’ to learn and connect. Let’s hope it was the first of many more to come, great job everyone involved!!
